        <h3>1) What is CSS?</h3>
        <p>CSS refers to <strong>Cascading Style Sheets.</strong> It's a stylesheet language used to control the look and feel of web pages written in HTML (or XML).
        <em>ie., <ol>
            <li>HTML builds the structure of a webpage,</li>
            <li>CSS styles the same webpage to look attractive and usable.</li>
        </ol></em>
        </p>
        <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS is basically used to define the appearance (colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, positioning, etc.,) of any element in HTML.</li>
                <li>CSS makes coding easier as it clearly seperates the <b>Content (HTML)</b> from <b>Presentation/Design (CSS)</b>.</li>
                <li>Makes websites responsive, adjustible to all screens.</li>
                <li>Allows consistent styling across multiple pages.</li>
                <li>Enhances website's performance and user experience.</li>
            </ul>
